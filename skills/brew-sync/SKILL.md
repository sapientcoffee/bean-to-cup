# Brew Sync Skill

This skill parses the active execution plan (`05_PLAN.md`), extracts implementation steps and checklists, and synchronizes them with GitHub Issues using the GitHub CLI (`gh`).

## 1. Objective
To automate the traceability of technical decisions and ensure that every item on the execution plan's checklist is mapped to an actionable, tracked issue on GitHub. This integrates Phase 5 (Execution Planning) with Stage 6/7 tracking.

## 2. Workflow Steps

1. **Locate Plan and Epic Context**:
   - Determine the plan file path. If not provided, search for the first `05_PLAN.md` under `plans/feature/*`.
   - Identify the parent Epic Issue ID. If not explicitly provided, look up `02_PRD.md` or parse active git branches and logs.

2. **Parse Implementation Plan**:
   - Run the python-based markdown parser to parse checkbox states, headers, dependencies, and verification criteria for each task inside the `05_PLAN.md`.

3. **Check Idempotency & Sorting**:
   - Perform a topological sort of extracted tasks based on declared dependencies (`*Depends On:*` metadata).
   - Query existing issues in the GitHub repository using `gh issue list` to prevent creating duplicate issues for already provisioned tasks.

4. **Provision Issues on GitHub**:
   - For any missing tasks, call `gh issue create` to initialize new tracked issues, attaching appropriate metadata, labels, and descriptions.
   - Link each new issue back to the parent Epic Issue.

5. **Post hand-shake Coordination Comment**:
   - Post a final coordination status comment to the parent Epic Issue notifying developers and peer agents that tasks are synchronized and ready for human review.

## 3. Parameters and Flags

The underlying synchronization engine (`scripts/sync.py`) accepts the following flags:
*   `--plan <path>`: Optional path to the target plan markdown file.
*   `--epic <id>`: Optional target GitHub Epic Issue number.
*   `--dry-run`: Dry-run mode to parse and print sequenced tasks without writing changes to GitHub.

## 4. Execution Example

### Standalone Dry Run:
```bash
python3 scripts/sync.py --plan plans/feature/20260618-sync-automation/05_PLAN.md --dry-run
```

### Full Synchronization:
```bash
agy brew:sync --plan plans/feature/20260618-sync-automation/05_PLAN.md --epic 123
```
